    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sundubu jjigae is a Korean stew made with soft (uncurdled) tofu as a highlight ingredient.</p>
    <p>There are a few different ways to make sundubu jjigae using different ingredients (e.g. kimchi, minced pork and seafood) but by far my favorite version is the seafood version known as Haemul Sundubu Jjigae (해물 순두부 찌개).  You can really taste the refreshing and clear tasting soup.</p>
    <p>In general, sundubu jjigae is a bit spicy though I think my recipe is in the modest pepper scale. Nevertheless, the spiciness of the stew can vary depending on the types of chili powder / chili flakes you use. Also, whether you used chili oil or neutral oil. A spicier version can potentially make you sneeze while you’re cooking and may even tickle your throat.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, it’s a refreshing, delicious and very comforting stew you can enjoy any time of the year!</p>
